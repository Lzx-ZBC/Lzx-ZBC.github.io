# 👨 About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://nuaa.edu.cn/), focusing on Large Language Models, Data Generation and Information Extraction. Google Scholar: [Follow me!🙂](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=--fIAWAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Now I am engaged in research at [NUAA NLP LAB](https://nuaa-nlp.github.io/  ) under the guidance of Associate Professor [Hongliang Dai](https://hldai.github.io/) and Professor [Piji Li](https://lipiji.com/ ), as well as currently interning at [HiThink Research](https://github.com/HiThink-Research/).

[M-BRe: Discovering Training Samples for Relation Extraction from Unlabeled Texts with Large Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.264.pdf)

**Zexuan Li**, Hongliang Dai, Piji Li

- This work proposes the M-BRe framework, which strategically combines multi-class and binary classification to efficiently discover high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for relation extraction, achieving comparable accuracy to exhaustive binary classification with significantly reduced computational overhead.

[Generating Diverse Training Samples for Relation Extraction with Large Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.35.pdf)

**Zexuan Li**, Hongliang Dai, Piji Li

- This work investigates methods to enhance the diversity of LLM-generated training samples for relation extraction through iterative In-Context Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, thereby overcoming the limitation of repetitive phrasing and structural patterns in directly generated samples.
